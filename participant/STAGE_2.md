# All Hands on Tech — Stage 2 (Participants)

## Stage 2 — Data check

In the repo, there is a CSV file:

`data/ops_metrics.csv`

**Goal:** Compute the value requested below, then turn it into the next **codeword**.

### Task
1. Open `data/ops_metrics.csv`.
2. Find the **team** with the highest **resolved_tickets**.
3. Take that team’s **team_code** and submit it as the codeword.

**Notes**
- You can solve this by sorting in a spreadsheet, or with a tiny script, or even manually.
- If there’s a tie, choose the team that comes **first alphabetically** by `team_name`.

✅ Submit the codeword (the `team_code`) to the host.
