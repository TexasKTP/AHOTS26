# All Hands on Tech — Stage 1 (Participants)

## Stage 1 — “What we don’t see”

You now have access to the repo content for this hunt on your laptop.

**Goal:** Find the hidden “flag” file and extract the next **codeword**.

### Constraints
- You may use terminal commands, your file explorer, or whatever tools you like.
- The codeword is inside a text file somewhere in the repo.

### Clues
- Some files are “hidden” by convention.
- Sometimes what you need is not in the obvious folder.
- If you get stuck, ask the host for **Hint 1** (they have a hint ladder).

✅ When you find the codeword, submit it to the host.
