## Stage 3 — Signal in the noise

In the repo, there is a JSON file:

`data/status_payload.json`

**Goal:** Extract the next **unlock phrase** from the JSON.

### Task
1. Open `data/status_payload.json`.
2. Find the field: `next_unlock`
3. Submit the value of `next_unlock` to the host as your codeword.

**Hint:** JSON is just structured text—use your editor’s search.
