# All Hands on Tech — Scavenger Hunt (Participants)

**Team size:** 3–4  
**Time limit:** ~45 minutes  
**Rules:**  
- You must **unlock each stage** by submitting the **codeword** to the host.  
- Once the host confirms, they will share the next stage instructions.  
- You can use any tools you want (terminal, Google, Python, spreadsheets), but keep it friendly & collaborative.

## Stage 0 — Boot Sequence

You’ve been handed a “startup packet” from the Tech Ops team. It contains an encoded message:

```
Q09ERVdPUkQ6IFNUQVJUVVAKQ0xVRTogVGhlIG5leHQgc3RlcCBpcyBpbiB0aGUgcmVwby4gRmluZCB0aGUgZmlsZSB0aGF0IGRvZXNuJ3Qgd2FudCB0byBiZSBmb3VuZC4KSElOVDogQmFzZTY0IGlzIG5vdCBzb21ldGhpbmcgeW91IG5lZWQgdG8ga2VlcCBtZW1vcml6ZWQu
```

**Your task**
1. Decode the message.
2. Extract the **codeword**.
3. Submit the codeword to the host.

✅ When you’re done: tell the host **the codeword**.

**Hint (if you need it):** This is a common encoding used in web/dev tooling.
