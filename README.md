# All Hands on Tech — Scavenger Hunt Repo

This repo contains a **45-minute, beginner-friendly** tech scavenger hunt for teams of 3–4. DONT PANIC.

## Quick start (host)
1. Upload these files to a GitHub repo.
2. Share the repo link + clone instructions with participants.
3. Start by giving teams the contents of `participant/STAGE_0.md` only.
4. Validate codewords using `host/ANSWER_KEY.md`.
5. Release stages one at a time per `host/RUN_OF_SHOW.md`.

## Repo layout
- `participant/` — Stage instruction pages (release one at a time)
- `host/` — Run-of-show, hint ladders, answer key
- `assets/` — Stage 1 hidden flag
- `data/` — Stage 2 CSV + Stage 3 JSON

## Suggested participant setup
- One laptop per team is enough
- Any OS is fine
- If they can’t use terminal, they can still solve by opening files in an editor

## Customization
- Edit codewords in `assets/.ops/flag.txt`, `data/ops_metrics.csv`, and `data/status_payload.json`.
- Update `host/ANSWER_KEY.md` accordingly.
